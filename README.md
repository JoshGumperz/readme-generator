Readme Generator

For this assignment, We were tasked with creating a program that generates a README.md file for you based on your input.

### Prerequisites

In order to get started using the Readme Generator, you'll need to have Node installed, and you'll need to run the command to run the "npm i" command to install inquirer and fs.

## Getting Started

Once you've installed the necessary prerequisites, you can start using the generator. And in order to show you how to use the generator, I've included an instructional that takes you through the steps of generating your own custom README. The video will be linked below, along with a step by step explanation.

If you need a little additional instruction, don't worry. Here's how it works:
The first thing you'll wanna do after opening up your terminal is run the command "node index.js"

After entering the "node index.js" command, the generator will initialize and you will be prompted as follows:

Just input your answer to each prompt question and your input will be recorded and stored in the final generated README.

For the 6th and 7th prompts, you will be asked to choose a license for your project, as well as a color for your license badge.

For these ones, no need to input any text, just navigate to your preferred choice using the arrow keys and hit Enter.

The text prompts will then continue as you will be asked to input a section on contributing to your application if it is open source, then finally you will be prompted to enter your email and github username

If all goes well after following all the steps accordingly you will see this success screen

Your README file with then be generated and placed in the Generated-READMEs folder with all of the information you input.
